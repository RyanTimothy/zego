# Zego
A personal introduction to a lexer, parser and rules engine based off of the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa).

The lexer is inspired by the Rob Pike's lecture on [Lexical Scanning in Go](https://youtu.be/HxaD_trXwRE).

## How does Zego work?

Currently in development and does not yet work as intended.
